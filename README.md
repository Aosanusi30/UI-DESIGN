# UI-DESIGN
This is to showcase my skills on UI/UX design. Kindly rate my work and profer recommendations when necessary.


DESCRIPTION
----
This is to showcase my skills on UI/UX design for website and mobile apps. All files have been zipped into a folder. Adobe XD was used for the design and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) was used to write the program. The prototype has been transformed into a reality. 

DEVELOPMENT
----
The Prototype was designed using html, sass and java script. I find sass more power and easy to use because of it nesting. The wesite also have animation and transistion with different view from a mobile, tablet and desktop view.
